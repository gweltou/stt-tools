# stt-tools

Split files .split should be in the same folder as its related audio file and text file.


## Python packages dependency

 * numpy ($ pip3 install numpy)
 * [Librosa](https://librosa.org/)
 * Pydub
 * Hunspell ($ pip3 install cyhunspell)
 * Colorama

## Transcription rules

Numerals should be written in all letters
(E.g. "1942" --> "mil nav c'hant daou ha daou ugent")

Acronyms should be written in capital letters with no dots or dashes
(E.g. UNESCO, COP21)

Regional forms should be kept if their pronouciation is far from the "standard" form
(E.g. "meump bet/on eus bet", "nege/an hini eo", "lÃ¢ret/lavaret")
 
## Workflow

Run script ``unpack.py`` found in each dataset folder.

Run script ``wavesplit.py audiofile.wav`` on each audiofile in datasets to generate ``.split`` file and manually align text (in ``.txt`` file) with audio utterances.

Run script ``verify_text_files.py dataset/`` on each dataset folder to quickly check spelling mistakes and register acronyms.

Divide datasets in ``train`` and ``test`` sets.

Run script ``build_kaldi_files.py folder/`` on ``train`` and ``test`` folders.

Copy generated ``data`` folder in your Kaldi recipe folder.

Run ``run.sh`` script in kaldi recipe folder.

Cry, wishing you had a GPU, while waiting for dozens of hours.

When training is finally done, run script ``copy_final_result.sh`` to copy necessary files in ``model`` folder.

Rename ``model`` folder and copy it in vosk ``model`` subfolder.

Enjoy !

## Data files
 * corrected.txt
    List of key -> values separated by a tabulation.
    Two types of corrections, single token substitution or raw text substitution (when a space is present in key).
    Single token corrections are case insensitive.
    
 * capitalized.txt
 * acronyms.txt
 * lexicon_add.txt
    Store additional regional pronouciations for breton words
 * lexicon_replace.txt
    Replace phonetics for words in lexicon (foreign words for instance)

## TODO
 * Retrain with long utterances only dataset
 * try reduce the size of the model (number of hidden layer) as well as the number of epochs
